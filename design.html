				<h3>Mechanic and Organic under the sea classwork</h3>
				<p>Even though this wasn't designed on Adobe Illustrator, I thought this poster was similar to Graphic Design. What I was hoping for the viewer to get behind what I designed is that eventually in the future everything under the sea/ocean will be covered in mechanic items.

				<h3>Maneki Neko classwork</h3>
				<p>This was one of the Design Process &amp; Practice labwork. I decided to add in this work because it was my first time using and understanding the basic tools of Adobe Illustrator. After using Adobe Illustrator, I realised that I also enjoy Graphic Design.</p>

				<h3>Mental Health Poster Assignment</h3>
				<p>I design this was my first Design Process &amp; Practice assignment in first year. The message behind this poster is how we leave everything bottled up and it begins to crack. You are inside the bottle hiding from everything and emotions then you finally see what its like outside of the bottle and you begin to cry because you are finally letting your emotion out and talking to someone about it.

				<h3>The Good Dinosaur Bookcover Assignment</h3>
				<p>This was one of my assignment for my Visual Design class. I designed this book cover in second year. The assignment was to design a book cover of any movie you like. I decided to design it based on the Disney movie 'The Good Dinosaur'. For the cover, I wanted to design what was important in the movie. In this case, it was the mountains and the lake. </p>

				<h3>Fashion Inc, 2nd Year Group Project Poster</h3>
				<p>This Fashion Inc. poster was for our Group Project. We were asked to design a poster for our assignment. We wanted a poster that is free going and something simply. It is simply but also eye catching because of the colours we used in this poster. There wasn't any brief of what we needed to add in so we decided to add in what we thought it was best for our project.</p>

				<img src="images/route32.jpg" alt="Route 32">
				<h3>Route 32 Ad Poster</h3>
				<p>This wasn't for college, my cousin asked me to design her and her team a poster. There project was to design an ads poster that represents a new airline. Route 32 was the name of their project. They didn't have any logo so I designed some logo for them and let them choose which one they would like. In my opinion, this isn't one of my best work. It was done in a short amount of day. </p>

				<h3>Indie Rock Festival Draft Poster Assignment</h3>
				<p>I design this in my second Design Process &amp; Practice assignment in first year. This poster was a draft poster, the poster tells us that it is an Indie Rock festival poster. The lines for the background would easily catch your eyes when you walked past it. It looks like itâ€™s coming out of the poster but not really at the same time.

				<h3>Nintendo Pop Art Magazine Assignment</h3>
				<p>This was another assignment for my Visual Design class. We were assigned with a certain theme and design a magazine based on what you got. I got Pop Art and decided to do it on Nintendo games. All the illustration was designed by myself. I got all the informaton online. This was one of my favourite work.</p>

				<h3>Project Book for 2nd Year Group Project </h3>
				<p>We were asked to put a Project Book together based on our Group Project. The cover page has our name and a illustrator of our portrait profile. On the front and last page, we added in our project name 'Fashion Inc.' and the logo we decided to use for this project. All the content pages has the same background. Even though we want each page to have their own unique background, it would be difficult to read and follow the information.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<img src="images/ninja.jpg" alt="Ninja zombie">
				<h3>Ninja Zombie </h3>
				<p>This wasn't for college, I designed this for my little brother. As cringe as it sound, he has a gaming channel on YouTube. His profile before didn't really match up with his username so I offered to make a new for him since I already edit his video. His channel name is 'Ninja Z70', the 'Z' stands for 'Zombie' so I wanted a zombie ninja. As if the ninja died and came back to live. Hence, the blood and brain coming out of the head. </p>
