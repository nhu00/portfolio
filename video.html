					<h3>Summer Holiday in Malaga, Spain</h3>

						<h3>The Device</h3>
						<p><b>Password:</b> thedevice<br>
						This assignment was to make a short film for Digital Video Techniques, it was to show that we understood how and what we can do when recording. To show that different video techniques we learned in class with a story behind it. The message behind this video is that we are always on our phone and never appreciate what we have around us but what happens when you didn't have a phone for a few days?

						<h3>Alvin Pascal, 2nd Year Group Project Interview</h3>
						<p>This interview was for our Group Project assignment in second year. We asked one of my friend to be in the video for us, I asked Alvin because I know he loves fashion and is always keeping up with the trends. Alvin’s style is a reflection of his taste in music. He credits Travis Scott as one of his style influencers along with Tyler the creator and Kanye wets, he believes they have made a big change to his life and given him the confidence to wear the fashion he does now.</p><br>

						<h3>Carlos Cleto, 2nd Year Group <br>Project Interview</h3>
						<p>This interview was also for our Group Project assignment in second year. We asked my cousin's friend to be in the video for us because I knew he has a certain style he wore in the past and now. Carlos believes his style is reflection of who he is and how he wants to be portrayed. He takes inspiration from a mix of decades but mostly from the nineties skater scene with touches of new brands and trends. He describes his style as a mix of casual street style.</p><br>

							<h3>Alina and Adina Toader, 2nd Year <br>Group Project Interview</h3>
							<p>This was another interview for our Group Project assignment in second year. We asked these twins because I knew they been wearing the same style since they were kids. They describe their style as trendy, casual but with added personality with the use of accessories. They use fashion as a way to express themselves, fashion is a key part of their lives it’s a way for them to tell the world who they are and how close of a bond they have together.

						<h3>Wreck It Ralph, ADR &amp; Foley,<br> Digital Audio</h3>
						<p><b>Password:</b> DAfoley<br>
						This was one of the lab work we had to do for Digital Audio in second year. This was one of my favourite work for this module. We had to do an ADR and Foley on any scene from a film/tv show. I decided to do it on 'Wreck It Ralph' because it's one of my favourite Disney movie. I got my brother to do the voiceover for me and I got the foley on <a href="http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/">BBC Sound Effect.</a>
